***MNIST Handwritten Classification***

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using various algorithms. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in recognizing digits from images and to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques in image classification.

The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is a well-known benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each 28x28 pixels in size. This project aims to build models that can accurately classify these digits.
